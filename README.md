[See Documentation](https://docs.devtodollars.com)

## Getting Started

To get started, choose which frontend you need and go from there:

- [Choose Flutter](./flutter/README.md) if you plan to build or expand into cross-platform apps (e.g. Duolingo, Fitbit, Spotify, Tinder, etc.)
- [Choose NextJS](./nextjs/README.md) if SEO, page load speeds, and web-specific libraries are integral to your app (e.g. Shopify, Medium, Wix, etc.)

Additionally, it's also possible to start with one-platform and move onto the next one depending on your needs. For example, start with Next.JS and then move to Flutter when a mobile app is needed. Both are configured to work straight out of the box.
